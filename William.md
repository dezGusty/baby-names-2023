# William

## Etimologie

A name of kings and conquerors, William is a powerful and popular boy’s name. First introduced to England by William the Conqueror in 1066, the name has stood the test of time and remains fashionable throughout the English-speaking world. Despite this, William is actually German in origin. It derives from the Germanic Wilhelm, whose roots wil (“will, desire”) and helm (“helmet, protection”) combine to mean “resolute protector”—a bold meaning that will mark baby out as a defender of the vulnerable. On a lighter note, William also has several endearing and playful nicknames. These include Will, Willy, Bill, Billy, and even Liam—diminutives that will let baby William distinguish himself on the playground.
