# DANTE

The name Dante is boy's name of Italian, Latin origin meaning "enduring".
Though closely associated with the great medieval Florentine poet Dante Alighieri -- who's so famous most people skip the last name -- it's not as much of a one-man name as you might think. Heck, it's not even a one-poet name, thanks to British pre-Rapahaelite Dante Gabriel Rosetti. Though especially well used in the Italian-American community, it would make a striking name for any little boy.

## Origin
Dante is an Italian name derived from the Latin Durante, which means “steadfast” or “enduring.” The name is most well-known as the surname of the famous Italian poet, Dante Alighieri, who wrote the epic poem “The Divine Comedy.”

## Gender: Dante is most often a boy name.
## Pronunciation: DAHN-tay
