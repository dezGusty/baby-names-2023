In the Old Testament's book of Genesis, Noah was chosen by God as the only righteous man of his time. He was told to gather animals "two by two" from every species and build the Ark, which allowed him, his family, and the animals to survive the Great Flood meant to punish the world. After the flood, he received the sign of the rainbow as a covenant from God that the entire Earth would not be destroyed again by a flood again.
